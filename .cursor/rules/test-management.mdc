# Test Management Rule

**Do not update or run tests unless explicitly requested by the user.**

When making code changes:
- Only modify test files if the user specifically asks to update tests
- Do not run tests automatically after making changes
- Do not suggest running tests unless asked
- Focus on implementation code changes without test modifications

If tests need to be updated or run, wait for explicit user instruction such as:
- "update the tests"
- "run the tests"
- "fix the failing tests"
- "write tests for this"
