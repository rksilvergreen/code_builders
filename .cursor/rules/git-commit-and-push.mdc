# Git Commit and Push Rule

When the user asks to "commit changes" or similar, always:

1. **Create a detailed commit message** that explains:
   - What changes were made
   - Why the changes were made
   - Benefits or improvements achieved
   - Any breaking changes or important notes
2. **Automatically push to remote** after committing, unless explicitly told otherwise
3. **Use conventional commit format** when appropriate (feat:, fix:, refactor:, etc.)
4. **Include context** about the scope and impact of changes

## Example format:
```
type: brief description

- Detailed bullet points explaining changes
- Technical details about implementation
- Benefits and improvements
- Any important notes for future developers
```
